# Add translatable fields to an app model Eg. News

1. create translation.py file 


2.  Add the following

from .models import NewsArticle, News
from modeltranslation.translator import TranslationOptions, register

class NewsArticleTranslationOptions(TranslationOptions):
    fields = ("title", )

translator.register(NewsArticle, NewsArticleTranslationOptions)

3.  run makemigrations on the app 
4.  migrate the app 
5.  If the database had data prior to translation, in order to copy the existing data to
    the default language,  
    run python manage.py update_translation_fields

6. Inside news.admin.py, register the translation admin 

from django.contrib import admin
from .models import *
from modeltranslation.admin import TranslationAdmin

# admin.site.register(NewsArticle)

@admin.register(NewsArticle)
class NewsArticleAdmin(TranslationAdmin):
    list_display = ("title",)

_______
At this stage, u should have translatable fields for each field u wanted


Advanced
1. Required fields, 
Model translation does not support to set translated fields like field_en or field_ax to be required even if 
the original field is set to null=False. To over come this just use one of the fields, example _en as default

- settings.py 
# Django settings
LANGUAGE_CODE = 'en'
LANGUAGES = (
    ('en', ('English')),
    ('ax', ('Amharic')),
    ('tx', ('Tigrigna')),
)

# modeltranslation setting
MODELTRANSLATION_LANGUAGES = ('ax', 'tx')

* with the above setting, only the Amharic and Tigrigna translations will be auto-generated will be generated,
and the original field will be considered as the default language which is en. 

original field can be set as required.

1. Not having field_en fields
